Software Evolution Monitor Tool
=========

The goal of the project is the development of a tool to be facilitate the assesment of [Lehm's laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution) on the evolution of software systems.

It is a project made for the undergraduate class of Software Engineering of the University of Ioannina - Greece during the fall semester of the academic year 2014 - 2015.

## Design

Both the design documents and the source code are included in the repo. Unfortunately the documentation is in greek but the diagrams that hold the essence of the desing can be understood fine.

The requested tool was quite lightweight so the design was base on the [Model-View-Presenter pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter).

The documenation includes the following:
* Requirements Definition (given by the tutor)
* Requirements Specification
* Architectural & Technical Design Document

Also there are included the packet, class and sequence diagrams that where designe with [Eclipse's](http://eclipse.org) plugin [Papyrus](http://eclipse.org/papyrus/).
